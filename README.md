# Stable Diffusion WebUI reForge-Exp

Stable Diffusion WebUI reForge-Exp is a platform on top of [Stable Diffusion WebUI reForge](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) (based on [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)) that targets to clean up the original implementation, study experimental features, and bring better performance on all platforms, including MacOS.
The postfix "Exp" means: Expedition, Exploration. The repo will target more aggressive optimization for generation.

# Features
- SURE SGPS Guidance samplers (a trajectory optimization sampler)
- Apple MLX support (much faster than MPS)
# Notice of usage of AI
reForge-Exp uses Claude Code as a coding agent; you may see Claude Code co-author some commits.
Currently, Claude Code is used to clean up the Forge framework design for better maintainability and to prototype new technology. 
I will run the repo almost daily to confirm it's working, the PR and issue are managed by me since I haven't trusted Claude for auto repair. 

# Suggested repos instead of reForge for stability

* Forge Classic: https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic, from @Haoming02 with a lot of optimizations and features, from reforge, forge, etc based on old backend of forge.
* Forge Neo: https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic/tree/neo, from @Haoming02.
It is a continuation of Forge2 (so Flux, fp8, gguf, etc) but with more features (wan 2.2, Qwen Image, Nunchaku, etc), aimed on optimizations and new features.
* ersatzForge: https://github.com/DenOfEquity/ersatzForge, from DenOfEquity, based on Forge2, but as he says, with (experimental, opinionated) changes to Forge2 webUI.



# reForge-Exp branches:
* main: Main branch with multiple changes and updates. This is default codebase 
# Orginal reForge branches
* dev: Similar to main but with more unstable changes. I.e. using comfy/ldm_patched backend for sd1.x and sdxl instead of A1111.
* dev2: More unstable than dev, for now same as dev.
* experimental: same as dev2 but with gradio 4.
* main-old: Branch with old forge backend. Possibly the most stable and older one (2025-03)

# Installing Forge/reForge
## Special Notice for regions that have a slow or dead GitHub connection
Seeing the repo page doesn't mean you have a stable connection to clone it. The script (all files ending in .bat and .sh) assumes you have a stable connection to clone the repo.
For this, you may need to use a VPN that supports TUN mode, or clone the repo with GitHub Desktop first. 
Please also notice that during installation, Python also needs to install packages to run this repo.

### (Suggested) Clean install
If you come from another WebUI, you may preserve the models folder. I highly suggest you manually remove the venv folder( .venv or venv), to avoid conflict in dependency. 
## First step, all OS must do this
Use any git tool, including GitHub Desktop, to clone this repo's code
If you are using git, here are the commands
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Panchovix/stable-diffusion-webui-reForge.git
cd stable-diffusion-webui-reForge
git checkout main
```
In the future, the WebUI script will be able to do this for you.

## Windows(7+)
You will need a working Python 3.11+ release. Python 3.14 is the current target; 3.11–3.13 also work fine. 
Python can be downloaded from here: 
Open PowerShell or Command Line Prompt. I recommend using the right-click menu's "Open with Terminal" entry to open it directly in Terminal. If you can't find it, use cd to change directory to repo.
Now check if you are using NVIDIA GPU. If not, in cmd arg, you add following line.
```bash
--skip-cuda-test
```
For NVIDIA GPU user, you now need to go to following link to know what kind of SM version you have.
SM Check out:
After that, go to Following link for cuDDN and CUDA runtime
CUDA:
cuDDN:
Notice that cuDDN require a developer account, you will need to register one, it's free and will grant you access to other libs that may need for other features.
Reboot your computer after install, these libs need reboot so Windows understand you just installed them.
Run webui.bat. Script will handle all initalization for you. 

# Linux
You will need a working Python 3.11+ release. Python 3.14 is the current target; 3.11–3.13 also work fine. The exact installation depends on your distro; search your distro's documentation for this step. 
Open your distro's terminal and change into repo dictory.
Now check if you are using NVIDIA GPU. If not, in cmd arg, you add following line.
```bash
--skip-cuda-test
```
Run webui.sh. Script will handle all initalization for you. 

## MacOS(M series chip)
You will need a working python 3.7+ release. Currently 3.11 is fine. 
Python can be download from here: 
Or use brew
```bash
brew install python@3.14
```
Open terminal, change into repo dictory
Run webui.sh, wait for initalazation, Control+C after it says "WebUI Started". We will kill the server to install MLX.
Now input command
```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
After hit Enter, you should see your terminal change into
```bash
(venv) > 
```
Now within the venv, use following command to install MLX 
```bash
python -m pip install mlx
```
After install complete, use following command to exist venv
```bash
deactivate
```
Now boot the WebUI again, this time you should see a banner says MLX activate.
## To update this repo
When you want to update:
```bash
cd stable-diffusion-webui-reForge
git pull
```

### If using Windows 7 and/or CUDA 11.x

For this, way to install is a bit different, since it uses another req file. We will rename the original req file to a backup, and then copy the legacy one renmaed as the original, to keep updates working.
For Windows CMD, it would be:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Panchovix/stable-diffusion-webui-reForge.git
cd stable-diffusion-webui-reForge
git checkout main
ren requirements_versions.txt requirements_versions_backup.txt
copy requirements_versions_legacy.txt requirements_versions.txt
```

Windows PS1

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Panchovix/stable-diffusion-webui-reForge.git
cd stable-diffusion-webui-reForge
git checkout main
Rename-Item requirements_versions.txt requirements_versions_backup.txt
Copy-Item requirements_versions_legacy.txt requirements_versions.txt
```

Then run webui-user.bat (Windows).

### You have A1111 and you know Git
Tutorial from: https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-animatediff/blob/forge/master/docs/how-to-use.md#you-have-a1111-and-you-know-git
If you have already had OG A1111 and you are familiar with git, An option is go to `/path/to/stable-diffusion-webui` and
```bash
git remote add reForge https://github.com/Panchovix/stable-diffusion-webui-reForge
git branch Panchovix/main
git checkout Panchovix/main
git fetch reForge
git branch -u reForge/main
git stash
git pull
```
To go back to OG A1111, just do `git checkout master` or `git checkout main`.

If you got stuck in a merge to resolve conflicts, you can go back with `git merge --abort`

-------

Pre-done or Pre-install package is planned, it will target for Windows user handle CUDA runtime issue. 

# reForge-Exp command line
reForge-Exp currently use command line args ADD function on top of reForge. If there is nothing in the following is specfic, it bahave like reForge (other than the MLX pipline, that is enable by default to avoid exterme slow MPS ops)
1. `--forge-diffusers-pipeline` This flag enable reForge-Exp's Diffuser pipline. The orginal Forge is trying to implement Diffuser and other webUI like SD.NEXT is based on Diffuser. This enable wider support of the model like FLUX and proper LoRA support of PyTorch compile (reForge given up to handle it). Performance wise, this also allows mmap loading of the model. Recommend add it after first generation is completed.
2. `--forge-diffusers-offload` When using `--forge-diffusers-pipeline`, move the whole HF UNet back to CPU after each sampling step to save VRAM. Adds one full transfer per step. Most aggressively save VRAM
3. `--forge-diffusers-sequential-offload` When using --forge-diffusers-pipeline, use accelerate per-block CPU offload: each UNet block moves to GPU just before its forward pass and returns to CPU immediately after (peak VRAM ≈ largest single block). Slower than --forge-diffusers-offload but uses significantly less VRAM. Takes precedence over --forge-diffusers-offload if both are set.
4. 
# Forge/reForge Backend

Forge/reForge backend removes all WebUI's codes related to resource management and reworked everything. All previous CMD flags like `medvram, lowvram, medvram-sdxl, precision full, no half, no half vae, attention_xxx, upcast unet`, ... are all **REMOVED**. Adding these flags will not cause error but they will not do anything now.

Without any cmd flag, Forge/reForge can run SDXL with 4GB vram and SD1.5 with 2GB vram.

**Some flags that you may still pay attention to:** 

1. `--always-offload-from-vram` (This flag will make things **slower** but less risky). This option will let Forge/reForge always unload models from VRAM. This can be useful if you use multiple software together and want Forge/reForge to use less VRAM and give some VRAM to other software, or when you are using some old extensions that will compete vram with Forge/reForge, or (very rarely) when you get OOM.

2. `--cuda-malloc` (This flag will make things **faster** but more risky). This will ask pytorch to use *cudaMallocAsync* for tensor malloc. On some profilers I can observe performance gain at millisecond level, but the real speed up on most my devices are often unnoticed (about or less than 0.1 second per image). This cannot be set as default because many users reported issues that the async malloc will crash the program. Users need to enable this cmd flag at their own risk.

3. `--cuda-stream` (This flag will make things **faster** but more risky). This will use pytorch CUDA streams (a special type of thread on GPU) to move models and compute tensors simultaneously. This can almost eliminate all model moving time, and speed up SDXL on 30XX/40XX devices with small VRAM (eg, RTX 4050 6GB, RTX 3060 Laptop 6GB, etc) by about 15\% to 25\%. However, this unfortunately cannot be set as default because I observe higher possibility of pure black images (Nan outputs) on 2060, and higher chance of OOM on 1080 and 2060. When the resolution is large, there is a chance that the computation time of one single attention layer is longer than the time for moving entire model to GPU. When that happens, the next attention layer will OOM since the GPU is filled with the entire model, and no remaining space is available for computing another attention layer. Most overhead detecting methods are not robust enough to be reliable on old devices (in my tests). Users need to enable this cmd flag at their own risk.

4. `--pin-shared-memory` (This flag will make things **faster** but more risky). Effective only when used together with `--cuda-stream`. This will offload modules to Shared GPU Memory instead of system RAM when offloading models. On some 30XX/40XX devices with small VRAM (eg, RTX 4050 6GB, RTX 3060 Laptop 6GB, etc), I can observe significant (at least 20\%) speed-up for SDXL. However, this unfortunately cannot be set as default because the OOM of Shared GPU Memory is a much more severe problem than common GPU memory OOM. Pytorch does not provide any robust method to unload or detect Shared GPU Memory. Once the Shared GPU Memory OOM, the entire program will crash (observed with SDXL on GTX 1060/1050/1066), and there is no dynamic method to prevent or recover from the crash. Users need to enable this cmd flag at their own risk.

Some extra flags that can help with performance or save VRAM, or more, depending of your needs. Most of them are found on ldm_patched/modules/args_parser.py and on the normal A1111 path (modules/cmd_args.py):

    --disable-xformers
        Disables xformers, to use other attentions like SDP.
    --use-sage-attention
        Uses SAGE attention implementation, from https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention. You need to install the library separately, as it needs triton.
    --attention-split
        Use the split cross attention optimization. Ignored when xformers is used.
    --attention-quad
        Use the sub-quadratic cross attention optimization . Ignored when xformers is used.
    --attention-pytorch
        Use the new pytorch 2.0 cross attention function.
    --disable-attention-upcast
        Disable all upcasting of attention. Should be unnecessary except for debugging.
    --force-channels-last
        Force channels last format when inferencing the models.
    --disable-cuda-malloc
        Disable cudaMallocAsync.
    --gpu-device-id
        Set the id of the cuda device this instance will use.
    --force-upcast-attention
        Force enable attention upcasting.

(VRAM related)

    --always-gpu
        Store and run everything (text encoders/CLIP models, etc... on the GPU).
    --always-high-vram
        By default models will be unloaded to CPU memory after being used. This option keeps them in GPU memory.
    --always-normal-vram
        Used to force normal vram use if lowvram gets automatically enabled.
    --always-low-vram
        Split the unet in parts to use less vram.
    --always-no-vram
        When lowvram isn't enough.
    --always-cpu
        To use the CPU for everything (slow).

(float point type)

    --all-in-fp32
    --all-in-fp16
    --unet-in-bf16
    --unet-in-fp16
    --unet-in-fp8-e4m3fn
    --unet-in-fp8-e5m2
    --vae-in-fp16
    --vae-in-fp32
    --vae-in-bf16
    --clip-in-fp8-e4m3fn
    --clip-in-fp8-e5m2
    --clip-in-fp16
    --clip-in-fp32

(rare platforms)

    --directml
    --disable-ipex-hijack
    --pytorch-deterministic
